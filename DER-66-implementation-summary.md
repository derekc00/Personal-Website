## Testing Notes

The editor is ready for use. To test:
1. Navigate to `/admin/content/new` to create new content
2. Or edit existing content at `/admin/content/edit/[slug]`
3. Type MDX content in the editor to see live preview
4. Try invalid MDX syntax to see error handling
5. Test on mobile to see tab-based interface
