# Understanding Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a fundamental graph algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It's widely used in applications like GPS navigation, network routing, and social network analysis.

## How it Works

1. Start at the source node
2. Keep track of the shortest known distance to each node
3. Visit the unvisited node with the smallest known distance
4. Update distances to neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found
5. Repeat until all nodes are visited

## Python Implementation

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from collections import defaultdict

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Initialize distances with infinity
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    # Priority queue to store (distance, node) pairs
    pq = [(0, start)]

    while pq:
        current_distance, current_node = heappop(pq)

        # If we've found a longer path, skip
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        # Check all neighbors
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # If we found a shorter path, update it
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

result = dijkstra(graph, 'A')
print(f"Shortest distances from A: {result}")
```

## JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
class PriorityQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.values = [];
  }

  enqueue(val, priority) {
    this.values.push({ val, priority });
    this.sort();
  }

  dequeue() {
    return this.values.shift();
  }

  sort() {
    this.values.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);
  }
}

function dijkstra(graph, start) {
  const distances = {};
  const queue = new PriorityQueue();
  const previous = {};

  // Initialize distances
  for (let vertex in graph) {
    distances[vertex] = Infinity;
    previous[vertex] = null;
  }
  distances[start] = 0;

  // Add start node to queue
  queue.enqueue(start, 0);

  while (queue.values.length) {
    const smallest = queue.dequeue().val;

    if (smallest === end) break;

    for (let neighbor in graph[smallest]) {
      const distance = distances[smallest] + graph[smallest][neighbor];

      if (distance < distances[neighbor]) {
        distances[neighbor] = distance;
        previous[neighbor] = smallest;
        queue.enqueue(neighbor, distance);
      }
    }
  }

  return { distances, previous };
}

// Example usage
const graph = {
  A: { B: 1, C: 4 },
  B: { A: 1, C: 2, D: 5 },
  C: { A: 4, B: 2, D: 1 },
  D: { B: 5, C: 1 },
};

const result = dijkstra(graph, "A");
console.log("Shortest distances from A:", result.distances);
```

## Swift Implementation

```swift
struct Edge {
    let to: String
    let weight: Int
}

class PriorityQueue {
    private var heap: [(String, Int)] = []

    func enqueue(_ vertex: String, priority: Int) {
        heap.append((vertex, priority))
        heap.sort { $0.1 < $1.1 }
    }

    func dequeue() -> (String, Int)? {
        return heap.isEmpty ? nil : heap.removeFirst()
    }

    var isEmpty: Bool {
        return heap.isEmpty
    }
}

func dijkstra(graph: [String: [Edge]], start: String) -> [String: Int] {
    var distances: [String: Int] = [:]
    let queue = PriorityQueue()

    // Initialize distances
    for vertex in graph.keys {
        distances[vertex] = Int.max
    }
    distances[start] = 0

    queue.enqueue(start, priority: 0)

    while !queue.isEmpty {
        guard let (current, _) = queue.dequeue() else { break }

        for edge in graph[current] ?? [] {
            let distance = distances[current]! + edge.weight

            if distance < (distances[edge.to] ?? Int.max) {
                distances[edge.to] = distance
                queue.enqueue(edge.to, priority: distance)
            }
        }
    }

    return distances
}

// Example usage
let graph: [String: [Edge]] = [
    "A": [Edge(to: "B", weight: 1), Edge(to: "C", weight: 4)],
    "B": [Edge(to: "A", weight: 1), Edge(to: "C", weight: 2), Edge(to: "D", weight: 5)],
    "C": [Edge(to: "A", weight: 4), Edge(to: "B", weight: 2), Edge(to: "D", weight: 1)],
    "D": [Edge(to: "B", weight: 5), Edge(to: "C", weight: 1)]
]

let result = dijkstra(graph: graph, start: "A")
print("Shortest distances from A:", result)
```

## Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
- Space Complexity: O(V + E)

## Applications

1. GPS Navigation Systems
2. Network Routing Protocols
3. Social Network Analysis
4. Game Development (pathfinding)
5. Transportation Planning

## Conclusion

Dijkstra's algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs. While the implementation might seem complex at first, understanding its core concepts is crucial for many real-world applications. The algorithm's efficiency and versatility make it a fundamental building block in computer science and software development.
